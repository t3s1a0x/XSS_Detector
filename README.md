# Advanced XSS Detector Tool
### Created by: Ali Qassem (@t3s1a0x)
This is an advanced tool designed to test websites for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The tool supports multi-threaded payload testing and includes advanced features like progress bars, colored outputs, and graceful interruption handling.

---

### Features
- **Multi-threaded Execution**: Fast payload testing using multiple threads.
- **Dynamic Progress Bar**: Visual representation of testing progress.
- **Colored Output**: Clearly distinguishes between various messages (errors, successes, info).
- **Graceful Interruption**: Handles Ctrl+C to exit the program cleanly.
- **Detailed Reports**: Outputs detailed information on detected vulnerabilities.
